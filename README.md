# Virtual Internships

A collection of realistic, end-to-end virtual internship projects across data science, analytics, data engineering, and AI.

## Overview

This repository contains simulation-based internship experiences designed to help learners gain practical, job-ready skills by building real-world systems with modern tech stacks.

Each internship is structured to mirror industry workflows, including stakeholder emails, Slack threads, weekly deliverables, and final demos.

## Domains Covered
