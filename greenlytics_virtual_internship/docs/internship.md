# Virtual Internship: Forecasting Urban Air Quality at Greenlytics

# About Greenlytics

**Greenlytics** is a fast-growing Series B **climate tech startup** headquartered in **Amsterdam**, dedicated to helping cities worldwide combat **air pollution** through the power of real-time data and advanced analytics. Our mission is to empower **urban decision-makers** with the tools they need to make faster, smarter, and more sustainable choices that protect public health and the environment.

At the core of our platform is a sophisticated data pipeline that **ingests real-time environmental data**—including air quality, traffic, weather, and emissions—from hundreds of IoT sensors and open data sources. This data is then processed through **predictive machine learning models** to forecast pollution levels, identify risk zones, and recommend timely interventions. Our **interactive dashboards** turn complex insights into **actionable intelligence** for city planners, public health officials, and transport agencies.

Our platform currently supports **over a dozen municipalities across Europe**, with **London** being our largest and most ambitious deployment. We’re proud to play a vital role in the city’s efforts to improve air quality through congestion planning, emissions zoning, and community alerts.

## Internship Story: Welcome to the Team

Congratulations! You've just joined **Greenlytics** as a **Data Science Intern** on the **Urban Insights Team**, part of our mission-driven effort to make city air cleaner and healthier through the power of data.

Your **six-week internship** will focus on helping us **forecast air quality in London**, one of our flagship partner cities. You'll work with historical environmental data (air pollutants, weather, emissions) and traffic datasets to uncover patterns, build predictive models, and translate your findings into **clear, actionable insights**. Your work will directly support efforts by the **City of London** to reduce pollution in critical hot zones.

### What You'll Be Doing

Over the course of the internship, your key responsibilities will include:

- Cleaning and analyzing large-scale environmental and traffic datasets
- Developing baseline and advanced forecasting models (e.g., regression, time series)
- Visualizing key trends and insights using Python or BI tools (e.g., Plotly, Tableau)
- Collaborating with cross-functional teams to understand stakeholder needs
- Packaging your insights into an interactive dashboard for city planners
- Presenting your findings on **Demo Day** to stakeholders at Greenlytics and the City of London

### You'll Be Working With

- **Anna Vermeer**, *Product Manager*  
  - Sets weekly goals, coordinates feedback loops, and ensures your work aligns with stakeholder needs. You'll meet with Anna in weekly sprint check-ins.

- **Dr. Ravi Kapoor**, *Lead Data Scientist*  
  - Your technical mentor. Ravi will guide you on model development, data strategy, and help review your work during code walkthroughs and whiteboard sessions.

- **Miguel Ortega**, *Senior Data Engineer*  
  - Provides access to the right datasets via our AWS-based data lake, helps you navigate our ETL pipelines and ensures your models are using clean, well-structured data.

- **Sophia Adomah**, *Head of City Engagement*  
  - Represents the end users—policy makers and urban planners. She'll attend your midpoint and final reviews to assess how your dashboard can help inform city decisions.

### Communication & Workflow

- **Tools**: Slack (daily comms), Notion (project tracking), GitHub (code), Zoom (weekly reviews)
- **Agile sprints**: 2-week sprint cycles with stand-ups every Monday and Friday
- **Mentorship time**: 1:1s with Ravi every Wednesday at 3 PM  
- **Demo Day**: Final presentation in Week 6 to the Greenlytics leadership team and City of London representatives

You're not just here to learn—you’re here to **make an impact**. The insights you generate could shape real-world environmental policy decisions. Welcome to Greenlytics. Let’s get started.

## Internship Goal

As a Data Science Intern at Greenlytics, your primary objective is to **build and interpret a machine learning model** that forecasts **Air Quality Index (AQI)** levels in London, enabling the City Council to proactively respond to pollution risks.

Over the course of six weeks, you will contribute to a real-world predictive analytics project with tangible impact. Your work will feed into Greenlytics’ decision-support platform used by London’s environmental and transportation teams.

### Key Deliverables

By the end of your internship, you are expected to deliver:

- **Cleaned & Feature-Engineered Datasets**  
  Prepare structured datasets using environmental, traffic, and weather sources. This includes handling missing values, aligning temporal frequencies, and engineering relevant features (e.g., lag variables, rolling averages).

- **A Trained, Interpretable ML Model**  
  Develop a forecasting model (e.g., linear regression, XGBoost, or LSTM) that predicts AQI values for different London zones. Emphasis will be placed on **interpretability**, using tools like SHAP or feature importance plots to explain model behavior.

- **Interactive Insights Dashboard**  
  Design a user-friendly dashboard (using Plotly Dash, Streamlit, or Tableau) to visualize pollution forecasts, risk zones, and influencing factors. This dashboard will be demoed to the City of London at the end of the internship.

- **Strategic Data-Backed Recommendations**  
  Use your findings to generate actionable recommendations for urban planning and policy—for example, optimal traffic rerouting during high-risk periods or alert thresholds for public health teams.

This internship will simulate the end-to-end lifecycle of a real data science project—from data collection and modeling to stakeholder communication and delivery. You'll be expected to think critically, experiment iteratively, and **translate data into decisions**.
