## Task 3: Model Interpretation & Policy Recommendations

### Overview
Bridge your model to real-world action by interpreting predictions and offering strategic advice to the City of London.

### Problem Context
City leaders want to know not just **what** the pollution forecast is, but **why** it's happening—and what they can do about it. You must translate model output into simple, policy-relevant language.

### Tech Tools
- SHAP
- Yellowbrick  
- GeoPandas (optional)  
- Markdown
- Word  
- Slack
- Email  

### Email from Sophia

> **From:** Sophia Adomah  
> **Subject:** Data to Policy — your help needed  
> **To:** Intern  
>
> Hi,  
>
> We’re preparing a policy briefing for the **City of London** next week. They’ve seen the forecasts — now they want to understand **what’s driving the spikes** in air pollution.  
>
> Can you help us answer these questions clearly and confidently?
>
> - Use **SHAP** (or another interpretable method) to explain the most influential features  
> - Identify **3 borough-level pollution hotspots** and investigate possible causes  
> - Recommend **2–3 practical actions** city leaders could take (e.g., optimize traffic signals, change delivery windows)  
>
> Make it **plain-English**. Your audience is a council member, not a data scientist. Clarity is more important than complexity.  
>
> Thanks so much — looking forward to your summary!

### Deliverables
- [ ] Run **SHAP analysis** on your trained model to interpret feature contributions  
- [ ] Extract the **top 3 features** consistently driving poor AQI forecasts  
- [ ] Identify **three borough-level hotspots** and describe patterns (e.g., Camden morning traffic, Westminster delivery spikes)  
- [ ] Write a **1-page summary for policymakers** that includes:
  - Borough-specific findings
  - Suggested root causes
  - **2–3 evidence-based recommendations** (e.g., traffic rerouting, emissions zoning)
  - Clear, concise language with no technical jargon

#### Example Summary Snippet

> In **Camden**, NO₂ levels consistently spike during weekday mornings.  
> The SHAP analysis indicates a strong correlation with traffic congestion between 7–9 AM.  
>
> **Recommendation**: Adjust traffic light timing and introduce a low-emission delivery window from 10 AM onward.
