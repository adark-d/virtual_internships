### Tech Tools  
- Power BI  
- Docker & Docker Compose  
- GitHub  
- Slack  

### Email from Marta Kruger

> - Map of idle scooters  
> - Daily ride volume (bar chart)  
>  
> Also: Dockerize Kafka, Spark, and Postgres for future city rollouts.

### Slack DM from Erik Mensah

> Create `docker-compose.yml` to spin up the entire stack.  
> We’ll reuse this as a base image for Amsterdam.
